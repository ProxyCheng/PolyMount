The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The setup now names the bundled source plugin in the configuration it writes. An empty plugin
  list means the host loads no plugins, so a fresh installation had no SVN source to choose from
  at all — the plugin was installed and inert.
- The Explorer context menu is no longer added twice on a machine where the setup registered it:
  the tray only looked under `HKCU`, read the setup's machine-wide entry as "not installed", and
  wrote a second copy beside it.

### Added

- The wizard lets the operator choose which bundled plugins to enable, and reconciles the
  configuration to that choice. Other plugin entries are left alone.
- One application icon, shared by the tray, the service and the setup, instead of none.
- The setup reports a missing `svn.exe` on the ready page, offers to restart Explorer when the
  source-colour dots were requested, and asks before deleting configuration and cached data on
  uninstall.
- Third-party notices, including the Qt Charts licensing consequence.
- CI: build, unit tests, plugin tests, two self-contained mount smoke tests, and an installer
  artifact.
